Our Space
---------------
Our space is hard to describe but we have been compared to a scrappy McMenamin's We have a large space but very clean and magical ( built as a hotel in 1904) our historical building has been lovingly restored .
We are not your usual space so please read carefully... think old school hotel / European hostel without the ghosts....or maybe there are ghosts you will have to see (wink wink) No ghosts that  are too precocious I promise :)
We have three shared and very clean bathrooms
One very well stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dishes and the like provided) 
And if you enjoy a morning coffee or tea / or evening glass of wine (or smoke) we have a very expansive back porch with couches , tables and a designated smoking area (New Orleans meets Georgetown)

 If you are sick please do not travel.  I'm a fairly warm person, i like to give hugs but currently I am keeping social distancing and ask that if you visit us that you do also.

Our Space
---------------
Our space is hard to describe but we have been compared to a scrappy McMenamin's We have a large space but very clean and magical ( built as a hotel in 1904) our historical building has been lovingly restored .
We are not your usual space so please read carefully... think old school hotel / European hostel without the ghosts....or maybe there are ghosts you will have to see (wink wink) No ghosts that  are too precocious I promise :)
We have three shared and very clean bathrooms
One very well stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dishes and the like provided) 
And if you enjoy a morning coffee or tea / or evening glass of wine (or smoke) we have a very expansive back porch with couches , tables and a designated smoking area (New Orleans meets Georgetown)

 If you are sick please do not travel.  I'm a fairly warm person, i like to give hugs but currently I am keeping social distancing and ask that if you visit us that you do also.

Laura works at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, supporting principal investigators at the Center for Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine. Josh is an architect designing educational architecture for schools throughout Seattle and the surrounding areas. When we're not working, we're either hiking, going to the movies, or hanging with our church community. 

We also LOVE to travel! Post graduation, Laura traveled for eleven months on a trip called the World Race, visiting a different country each month, doing various volunteer/service/mission work in each place. In that year we visited four continents, working in orphanages, teaching English, working in churches, clearing land, and connecting with communities all over the world! It certainly fueled a longing to explore, venture to new places, and experience new communities. But it has also grown an appreciation for a sense of ""home"" and comfort. Laura has visited 44 countries so far, and her dream would be to visit them all! 

We got married in April 2018, and spent our honeymoon in Chile - specifically the Patagonia region. When traveling, we're on the look out for the tastiest food spots, live music, best views, and any sort of fun, cultural events unique to that place. We hope to venture to many new places together.

In addition to being hosts, we are frequent Airbnb guests.

Not only are the Airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond Sydney, Australia, to include a handful of locations in our home state of Washington as well as cities throughout the U.S., and also other countries including Spain, Tanzania, France, Canada, England, Czech Republic, The Netherlands, and Germany. We've been a guest in more than 60 different Airbnb locations over the past 10 years. In fact, I can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!

Since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on Airbnb. Hosting has proven to be a fantastic experience since we are both seasoned travelers and enjoy chatting with others about their travels, etc.

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team.

I love to travel.  I look forward to winter snowshoeing, some US travel, hosting on airbnb and a trip to Germany (Autumn 2019).  2020 will be my 8th year as an airbnb host.   I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. 

My home is in the ""center of the Universe"" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  

2020 Holiday Season
Holiday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the annual Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2020 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  

Summer Solstice
The famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  Creator of the Ice Queenistas 2009-2012  I was an Ice Queen Clown in 2014  and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  

The Neighborhood
As to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a great view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.

FOODIE w/o gluten!!
After years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.
But I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.

For myself living without the open road, great friends, dream time, and my favorite shoes including some well seasoned ostrich boots from the Boot Lady in Seattle, is not an option.  

AND along with 2 treetop rooms upstairs, the cute and lovable 1 bedroom apartment is available for you too.  With a full kitchen and bath, and a great 40"" Vizio flat screen that works with your chrome cast service,  you will love it. If you want extra privacy, your own fridge and cooking space,  and/or room for a couple of friends to travel with you, pick this option.  If you want 100% remodeled please continue your search.  If you love the unique and artistic life, clean, well supplied and situated on a country lane in the city do check out ""Super cool in artsy Fremont""!     

Favorite coffee - Lighthouse Roaster from right up the street at 43rd and Phinney.
Favorite view - from the sun dial at the top of Gas Works Park hill.
Favorite Seattle park - Discovery Park
What I think about Eastern WA - it's an excellent secret - with wide open valleys, rolling hills, rivers, wheat fields and when the rain is over the top in Seattle, there's nearly always SUN!

How I feel about Puget Sound - big love - have to hop a ferry at least a few times a year to visit an Island or the Olympic Penninsula; have to walk on a gravel beach and skip a few rocks to remember the incomparable beauty of the place; seagulls make me happy.  Mt. Rainier is my sacred mountain - it calls me each year at least once to hike or snowshoe and feel the awesome presence of its magnetic core.  

I love traveling in France and Europe in general, Mexico, the American West and Southwest, and now, South America.  My favorite way to travel is to friends or family who live there.  Or with a group of like minded people on a small group tour.

I took his word and ended up renting a 1 bed/1 bath in Seattle. I enjoyed my AirBNB experience so much I listed my personal apartment.

I live in the expensive part of Seattle and am trying to makeup the downtown living by sharing my house with you. I have all the basics taken care of and strive to provide my guests with a clean and comfortable place to sleep. Please don't expect it to be a hotel service and please don't expect that I am the only person in the house, opening up the entire house up for you.
By nature I am kind, responsible, quiet, friendly and easy going. I love to be around people. I am looking to host kind and friendly females and friends. The original spirit of Airbnb (if you know the founding story) is dead now with commercialization. I am looking to revive it and foster trust and acquaintanceship, sharing experiences what not, just like hanging over with a friend. If that’s not you and you like to keep to yourself that’s fine by me as well.
Please let me know in advance if you have any special requirements. I will do my best to accomodate your requests!
Don’t get me into trouble and enjoy yourselves, I am always here with any tips and tricks of the town!
If you are booking an airbnb for the first time use my link booGPTKIB0 to get $40 credit

Our Space
---------------
Our space is hard to describe but we have been compared to a scrappy McMenamin's We have a large space but very clean and magical ( built as a hotel in 1904) our historical building has been lovingly restored .
We are not your usual space so please read carefully... think old school hotel / European hostel without the ghosts....or maybe there are ghosts you will have to see (wink wink) No ghosts that  are too precocious I promise :)
We have three shared and very clean bathrooms
One very well stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dishes and the like provided) 
And if you enjoy a morning coffee or tea / or evening glass of wine (or smoke) we have a very expansive back porch with couches , tables and a designated smoking area (New Orleans meets Georgetown)

 If you are sick please do not travel.  I'm a fairly warm person, i like to give hugs but currently I am keeping social distancing and ask that if you visit us that you do also.

After finishing college I began working as a software engineer on video editing software and have been doing that for the past 10+ years. In the intersection between science and art, I am most at home when form meets function in the most elegant ways. It is so exciting to be able to watch a movie and know exactly how it is made, right down the each pixel. If you're interested in this sort of thing, I love chatting about it-- but be forewarned, you may never be able to watch a movie the same way. The magic of film-making can sometimes go away when you know how it works.

As an engineer, I absolutely love fixing things and tinkering. Naturally, I spent the past several years upgrading our home. I decided it would be great to share all the upgrades and hard work I've done and list it on Airbnb. It really has been a labor of love for me.

We have three shared and very clean bathrooms
One very well stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dishes and the like provided) 
And if you enjoy a morning coffee or tea / or evening glass of wine (or smoke) we have a very expansive back porch with couches , tables and a designated smoking area (New Orleans meets Georgetown)

About the house:  The home is a large, three level 1888 built home (basement, main floor and 2nd floor) with three bedrooms on the 2nd floor.  In 2017, we renovated the home to create two separate living quarters: a space to allow our guests to find privacy and a space to allow us to live on-site and host (something we really enjoy).  We airbnb the 3, 2nd floor room.  Our short renters have the main entry (front door / green / with welcome sign) and a common room with filtered water, coffee / tea, microwave, mini-fridge and seating and dish ware and dish ware service.  

The home is in the Central District / Squire Park Neighborhood.  We walk or bus from our home .. very convenient location.  Within a few blocks include: mini-markets, cafes, Whole Foods Grocery, hospitals, many tasty small local business restaurants, local breweries, library, grocery store, coffee (of course!), Walgreens and more!  

Transportation: Parking is getting challenging in our area, we encourage folks to not bring a car if planning to park all day.  We have 2 hr street parking on our street, from 7 am - 6 pm but open blocks are near us and paid parking is 3 blocks away.  Most folks get around by walking, light rail, street car, bike, Uber / Lyft or the bus.  Below are distances to main attractions.

We met in New York while attending a graduate program and bonded over our mutual passion for meditation. The lush nature and peacefulness of Seattle attracted us, so once the opportunity to move presented itself, we seized it right away.  After a drive across the country we felt at home here right away.

I love all things food and sports (especially futball, basketball, football). I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering in Pennsylvania and Switzerland, worked all over America for the aviation industry and big tech, and now do research and work in academia in Computer Science. 

On the personal side, I am a former semi-pro soccer player and I played for my school's club MMA team. I am on and off about dieting but when I am, I'm strict on eating kosher/halal and as much seafood as possible. 

I am a huge foodie so any tips on food or even sightseeing your city are greatly appreciated! I speak several languages (some better than others). I love to travel and learn about different cultures so I tend to click with people. I've traveled most of Western Europe, half of America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

When you stay with me you may see projects in motion, functional art, experiments in off-grid heating and some creative detritus which lingers from all of THIS.

Sometimes there will be clutter. But if you need a specialty car seat or other rare object, I will go out of my way to manifest it.

My passion and personal challenge is to anticipate the needs of my guest before they even anticipate their own desires. (extra towels, airport pick up, dairy allergy, baby monitor because you are sleep training with Ferber method while traveling, but also want a cocktail while doing so, etc.) You may find me overly communicative in non-linear ways.
