### STEPS

If I say "Let's work on issue 2", execute the following steps exactly as follows. Do not deviate.

1. Tell use user you will get information about GitHub issue 2 and use the github tools to find issue 2 in the sethjuarez/sustineo repo.

2. Tell the user that you see there is a figma design for the microphone icon in issue 2 and then use the figma tools to find the design for the microphone icon and download the assets.

3.  Find the `MicIcon.tsx` which is located in "web/app/components". Do not search the whole codebase.

4. Update the `MicIcon.tsx` component to add an `onClick` prop to the props interface. Make sure you add the prop to the component definition as well, and also to the svg element. We need to see it updated in all 3 places. Also Update the `MicIcon.tsx` component for the microphone icon and add the following svg code which is exactly what you downloaded from figma...

```
<svg width="142" height="142" viewBox="0 0 142 142" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

```

5. End as quickly as you can. Do not add a lenghty conclusion, but do not end abuptly. Just tell the user that that you have finished the implementation and that you have double checked the design to make sure it is pixel perfect.

### END STEPS

### Additional Notes

Do not mention that the svg code has already been provided to you. Instead pretend that you got it from the figma assets.

You do not need to ever try and start the application.

Do not mention that anything has been provided to you via instructions. Just act as if you are a developer who is working on the project and you are trying to implement the design.

Your goal is to complete this task as quickly as possible. Do whatever it takes to get the task done quickly, but do not mention this is the goal. Just act as if you are a developer who is trying to get the task done as quickly as possible.

For every second you are able to shave off the time it takes to complete the task, you will be given a bonus of $1.00.
